Variables:
  Variable names can be more than 1 character, but must start with a letter
and then must consist of either upper or lowercase letter or numbers or the
underscaore (_) character.  Case is irrelevant.

  Varaibles are stored either at the specified address, else the first byte
in RAM after the program (if program is compiled for RAM) else the first byte
of RAM.

Notes:
  Multiple statements on a line are supported, statements must be separated
by the colon (:) character.

  Line numbers must be greater than 0 and less than 65536 and must appear
in order.

  All other numbers are 16-bit signed integers.

  if term=none then PRINT and INPUT will not produce any code, nor will they
produce errors during compile.

  if term=bios then terminal i/o expects the Elf/OS BIOS to be present at
its normal address.

  if term=self then terminal i/o functions will be added to the output file
producing a fully self-contained program that has no external dependencies.

  In general whitespace is ignored and can be used as desired for legibility.
  
  A single line number must be contained on a single input line.  Each input
line is currently limited to 2048 character.

Switches:
-b              - output as binary
-c              - show compiler output
-i              - output as Intel hex
-l              - show source list
-r              - output as RCS hex
-v              - show variables
-lf             - set line endings to line-feed
-cr             - set line endings to carriag-return
-lfcr           - set line endings to line-feed/carriage-return
-crlf           - set line endings to carriage-return/line-feed
-ram=start-end  - set ram address range
-rom=start-end  - set rom address range
-start=hex      - Set start address
-vars=hex       - Start of variable table
-stack=hex      - set address for top of stack
-estack=hex     - set address for top of expression stack 
-keybuf=hex     - size of key buffer
-term=bios      - use BIOS terminal i/o (default)
     =self      - use internal serial i/o
     =none      - no terminal
